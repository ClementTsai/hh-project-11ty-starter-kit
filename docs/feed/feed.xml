&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;At the turn of the twentieth century, numerous revolutions and calls for reformations broke out across the Qing Empire. Unable to suppress the people, China&#39;s dynastic government fell apart, leaving a massive power vacuum. The fall of the Qing dynasty not only marked the end of China&#39;s dynastic government, but also allowed for various ideologies to be nurtured and flourish. However, as a result, the rise of new ideologies also gave rise to new powerful factions which sought to wrangle control. These factions, though worked together to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and repel the Japanese invasion, fought against one another. However, with the withdrawal of the nationalists forces to the island of Taiwan, the conflict between the communists and the nationalists still persists, culminating in the current tensions in the Taiwan strait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;fall-of-the-qing&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Fall of the Qing&lt;a class=&quot;tdbc-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://hackinghistory.github.io/hh-project-11ty-starter-kit/China-Taiwan/#fall-of-the-qing&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After nearly three hundred years of imperial rule under the Qing dynasty, the 1911 revolution, or the Xinhai Revolution, brought an end to China’s two-thousand year long dynastic monarchy.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackinghistory.github.io/hh-project-11ty-starter-kit/China-Taiwan/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Following the collapse of China’s monarchial government, the revolutionists, under the leadership of Sun Yat-sen, formed the new Republic of China which then appointed Yuan Shikai as its first president. However, Yuan Shikai wanted to restore the hereditary monarchy in China by declaring himself the Hongxian Emperor.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackinghistory.github.io/hh-project-11ty-starter-kit/China-Taiwan/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Ultimately, his death and abdication in 1916 led to a massive fragmentation of the Chinese political system and a power struggle against multiple factions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;united-front&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;United Front&lt;a class=&quot;tdbc-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://hackinghistory.github.io/hh-project-11ty-starter-kit/China-Taiwan/#united-front&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To combat the threat of warlords controlling massive swathes of China, thus preventing a unification of China’s government, Sun Yat-sen would form a new government in Guangzhou with the Kuomintang. As Western powers refused to offer Sun Yat-sen military aid, he, and the Kuomintang, turned to the Soviet Union for assistance. As a result, the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang were jointly united to form the First United Front.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackinghistory.github.io/hh-project-11ty-starter-kit/China-Taiwan/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, shortly after the death of Sun Yat-sen in 1925, relations between the KMT and the CCP soured as a rumour began to manifest that the Soviet Union was seeking to destroy the KMT from within using the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-split&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The Split&lt;a class=&quot;tdbc-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://hackinghistory.github.io/hh-project-11ty-starter-kit/China-Taiwan/#the-split&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No longer tolerant of the communist influence within the ranks of the Kuomintang, Chiang Kai-shek, the succeeding leader of the KMT after Sun Yat-sen’s passing, joined several other KMT leaders to propose a communist purge. On April 12th, 1927, a violent suppression of the Chinese Communist Party and leftist elements in Shanghai were enacted by Chiang Kai-shek’s conservative forces and allies. The Shanghai Massacre effectively split the right and left wing factions within the KMT. Chiang Kai-shek would continue to lead the right-wing forces of the Kuomintang while the left-wing Kuomintang government was led by Wang Jingwei. Ultimately, the massacre also led to the collapse of the First United Front as communist forces began to launch uprisings to regain power - marking the start of the Chinese Civil War.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackinghistory.github.io/hh-project-11ty-starter-kit/China-Taiwan/#fn4&quot; id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;second-united-front&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Second United Front&lt;a class=&quot;tdbc-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://hackinghistory.github.io/hh-project-11ty-starter-kit/China-Taiwan/#second-united-front&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Japan’s sudden invasion and occupation of Manchuria, Chiang Kai-shek was forced to sign a truce with the Chinese Communist Party after being kidnapped by his own general in the Xi’an Incident. Both the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party momentarily halted their fighting to form a second united front to fight against the Japanese. However, in 1937, Japan’s full-scale invasion of China overran Kuomintang defenders in northern and coastal China, significantly weakening the nationalist forces. Despite their uneasy alliance, the cooperation between the two factions was unstable as they both vied for control and power. Furthermore, despite the military alliance against Japan, the two factions continued to engage in bloody clashes against one another. Eventually, the Second United Front collapsed after CCP forces were ambushed by the KMT during an evacuation of the Anhui and Jiangsu Provinces.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackinghistory.github.io/hh-project-11ty-starter-kit/China-Taiwan/#fn5&quot; id=&quot;fnref5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Kuomintang was the legal government of China at the time, they were forced to carry the burden of taking the full brunt force of the Japanese invasion. On the other hand, the Chinese Communst Party was able to commit themselves to guerilla war tactics that generally won them support in Japanese-occupied areas.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackinghistory.github.io/hh-project-11ty-starter-kit/China-Taiwan/#fn6&quot; id=&quot;fnref6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; By the end of the war, the Communist forces had grown to around 1.3 million members with a separate militia of over 2.6 million. The nationalists, on the other hand, suffered significant casualties to their forces during their clashes with the Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;communist-victory&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Communist Victory&lt;a class=&quot;tdbc-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://hackinghistory.github.io/hh-project-11ty-starter-kit/China-Taiwan/#communist-victory&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After resisting the invasion of Japanese forces, the two factions eventually returned to a full-scale war, with the Communist offensive in the Shandong Peninsula being largely successful.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackinghistory.github.io/hh-project-11ty-starter-kit/China-Taiwan/#fn7&quot; id=&quot;fnref7&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Ultimately, with the support of the people under communist-occupied lands and the CCP’s experience in guerilla warfare, much of the Kuomintang, which had already sustained heavy casualties during the Second Sino-Japanese War, were unable to resist. As a result, Chiang Kai-shek, the nationalist party, and the Kuomintang were forced to withdraw to the island of Taiwan while Mao Zedong proclaimed the founding of the People’s Republic of China in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;aftermath&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Aftermath&lt;a class=&quot;tdbc-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://hackinghistory.github.io/hh-project-11ty-starter-kit/China-Taiwan/#aftermath&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the following years, the Chinese Communist Party sought to crush the remnants of the Kuomintang on the island of Taiwan. However, their attempts were thwarted by the United States who offered their full support for Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang. After the Korean War, President Harry S. Truman issued for the United States Seventh Fleet to sail to the Taiwan Strait as part of his policy of containment against Communist influence. Thus, in the past few decades, both the CCP and KMT have declared themselves as the proper government of China. As such, tensions between Taiwan and China have become strained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-the-conflict-remains-relevant&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Why the Conflict Remains Relevant&lt;a class=&quot;tdbc-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://hackinghistory.github.io/hh-project-11ty-starter-kit/China-Taiwan/#why-the-conflict-remains-relevant&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As both the Taiwanese and Chinese government recognize themselves as the legitimate government of China&#39;s mainland, tensions have grown over the past few decades. While government of the People&#39;s Republic of China affirms that Taiwan is part of China, frequent disagreements have let to large amount of arms placed on either coasts. Moreover, with the United States defending Taiwan, tensions between the two nuclear powers have intensified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On an economic scale, Taiwan is responsible for 92% of the world&#39;s most advanced semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. These semiconductor chips are used across multiple industries such as technology, appliances and medical equipment. A disruption in its process would damage the global supply chain and likely cause further production slowdowns and a subsequent economic slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;

- Chiang Kai-shek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Of the Chinese Civil War, the Kuomintang, often referred to as the Nationalists party, and the Chinese Communist Party were the largest factions that played a major role in the Chinese Civil War and its subsequent outcome. Moreover, the leaders of each of the respective parties, Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong, decided how each event would unfold. This page will explore both Chinese parties as well as their leaders. Additionally, this page will also explore the &quot;Father&quot; of the Chinese republic that helped pave the way for both political parties to rise to prominence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt; Kuomintang (KMT) &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HF3A0lU.png&quot; alt=&quot;KMTFlag&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The Kuomintang (KMT), or sometimes referred to as the Guomindang (GMD), was a political party established by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen&quot;&gt;Sun Yat-sen&lt;/a&gt; in 1894 in Honolulu, Republic of Hawaii. Originally known as the Revive China Society, the party transformed itself as part of the 1911 revolution that overthrew the ruling Qing dynasty. Eventually, in 1919, Sun Yat-sen re-purposed the party under the name of the Kuomintang. The party was succeeded by Chiang Kai-Shek who oversaw the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Expedition&quot;&gt;Northern Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to unite regional warlords under the banner of China. During the Second World War, the nationalists fought against the Japanese in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War&quot;&gt;Second Sino-Japanese War&lt;/a&gt;. While the Kuomintang were able to repel the Japanese, they were shortly defeated by the 1949s at the hands of the Chinese Communist Party in a gruelling civil war which saw the remnants of the Kuomintang withdraw to Taiwan.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:white&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:white&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:white&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt; Chinese Communist Party (CCP) &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Ly1KnRH.png&quot; alt=&quot;CCPFlag&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), officially known as the Communist Party of China (CPC), was founded in 1921 by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao with the help of the Far Eastern Bureau of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Within its first years of operation, the CCP aligned itself with the Kuomintang until the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_massacre#:~:text=The%20Shanghai%20massacre%20of%2012,conservative%20factions%20in%20the%20Kuomintang%20()&quot;&gt;Shanghai Massacre&lt;/a&gt; which Chiang Kai-Shek intended to purge the communists from China. The following years resulted in a brutal civil war between both political parties. Eventually, Mao Zedong rose to the forefront as the leader of the Chinese Communist Party by establishing a strong following with rural peasants with his land reform policies. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, both political parties momentarily put aside their differences to fight the invading Japanese. However, after their victory, the Chinese Civil War continued which saw the astounding victory of the CCP.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Chiang Kai-shek was born in the Qing Empire in October 1887. He was a Chinese Nationalist politician who, as a part of the Kuomintang, helped Sun Yat-sen overthrow the Beiyang government and reunify China. For much of his early days as a politician, he worked closely with both the nationalists and communists to solidify China’s unity by subjugating various warlords. However, midway through the Northern Expedition, the KMT-CCP alliance shattered and a civil war was triggered. As the head of a recovering China, Chiang Kai-shek was tasked with repelling the invading Japanese forces during the Second Sino-Japanese War as well as continuing his suppression of the communists. However, he and the Kuomintang were eventually defeated by the Communists Party in 1949. Withdrawing to the island of Taiwan, he served as the President of the Republic of China and the Director-General of the Kuomintang until his death in 1975.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Born in 1866 in the Qing Empire, Sun Yat-sen is considered to be the “Father” of the Republic of China for his role in overthrowing the Qing Dynasty during the Xinhai Revolution. As one of the few 20th-century Chinese leaders revered by both the Mainland China and Taiwan, Sun Yat-sen’s political journey was a tumultuous one riddled with constant strife and exiles. His success in founding the Republic of China after the 1911 revolution and his contributions in forging an alliance between the Kuomintang and Chinese Communist Party during the 1920s demonstrates his capabilities as a leader. However, Sun Yat-sen died in March 1925 as a result of gallbladder cancer, and, as a result, was unable to see the Kuomintang unite the country under his successor, Chiang Kai-shek.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:white&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:white&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:white&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt; Mao Zedong &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Born in 1893 in the Qing Dynasty to a relatively prosperous peasant, Mao Zedong, commonly referred to as Chairman Mao, was a founding member of the Chinese Communist Party and was heavily influenced by the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 and the May Fourth Movement of 1919. He helped to found the Chinese Red Army, eventually becoming the head of the Chinese Community Party during the Long March which saw much of the manpower of the CCP dwindle under the violent suppression of the KMT. However, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek momentairy formed an alliance against the Japanese. After Japan’s surrender, the CCP and KMT resumed their conflict which ultimately saw Mao Zedong’s forces defeat the Nationalist government and assume control of China.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt; This page will show a rough timeline of the territorial changes during the Chinese Civil War. By the end of the Second World War, and the Second Sino-Japanese War, much of China was controlled by the Kuomintang. The early success of the Kuomintang forced the Communist party to meet for negotiations and peace talks. However, by 1947, Communists forces that resumed their offensive in Manchuria were able to make significant gains. By 1948, the Nationalists lost their initiative and struggled against the Communist momentum. And, near the end of 1949, most of Mainland China was under communist control, forcing the remnants of the Kuomintang to neighbouring countries or across the Taiwan strait to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt; Year &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt; Event &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt; 1945 &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Japanese unconditionally surrender to the Allied forces, with much of the Japanese troops in China told to surrender to the Kuomintang.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;First post-war peace negotiations take place in Chongqing, attended by both Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nationalists forces pushed as far as Jinzhou. Met with the communist counter-offensive which took over the majority of the Shandong Peninsula, except for the regions controlled by the USA.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt; 1946 &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The truce between the Kuomintang and the Communist party collapses, leading to a full-scale civil war once more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With the outbreak of the war, nationalists forces are relocated to recently-liberated cities to prevent the spread of the communist forces.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A large scale assault on Communist holds in Northern China was launched under the orders of Chiang Kai-shek.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt; 1947 &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Kuomintang achieve a symbolic victory by capturing the capital of the Communist forces in Yan&#39;an. However, massive counter-offenses are launched by the Communists, particularly in Northern and Eastern China.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt; 1948 &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;With the Communist Lioshen Campaign, the Chinese Communist Party is able to take control of North-eastern China as well as subduing the Kuomintang&#39;s most well-trained army.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Continuous Communist victories not only grant the communist forces large swathes of previously Nationalist-held territory, but also resulted in the capture of military assets provided by the United States for the Kuomintang.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt; 1949 &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Yangtze River Crossing Campaign results on an overwhelming Communist victory with the capture of the Kuomintang capital of Nanjing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Kuomintang government retreat to Guangzhao, then to Chongqing, and then Chengdu before finally retreating across the Taiwan strait to Taiwan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last ditch attempts by the Kuomintang forces to repel the communist forces in south-west China prove to be fruitless&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mao Zedong declares the establishment of the People&#39;s Republic of China with its capital in Bejing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chiang Kai-shek declares Taipei as the temporary capital of the Republic of China and declares its legitmacy as China&#39;s sole government.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
