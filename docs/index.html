<p align="justify">Welcome to Clement's website! This site was built for HIS496. This page will include a short explanation of its intent, it's intended audience, and what each tab offers.</p>
<h4><b>Purpose</b></h4>
<p align="justify">This site aims to introduce the cause of tensions between China and Taiwan by delving into the Chinese Civil War and reviewing the causes. By understanding the development of the civil war and its evolution into a Chinese “Cold War”, we can better understand why rumours of a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan are circulating amidst the Russian-Ukraine war.</p>
<h4><b>Audience</b></h4>
<p align="justify">The intended audience is for younger students in middle and high school, from grades 6 to 12. The content is not intended to teach nor provide every detail of the Chinese Civil War, but rather to bring awareness to it and why it affects current Taiwan-Chinese relations.</p>
<h4><b>Structure</b></h4>
<p align="justify">The site hosts <b>three tabs</b> which students can explore further. 
<p><b>The first tab</b> (China-Taiwan Conflict) will provide a brief contextualization and several reasons as to why the conflict manifested and has continued to persist over the decades. It is written with sub-headers to provide students with an easier way to read and understand how it connects to the overarching narrative of the Chinese Civil War.</p>
<p><b>The second tab</b> (Major Factions and Figures) will introduce students to key figures who either influenced or led the Kuomintang or Chinese Communsit Party during the civil war. It will provide a brief explanation of the significance of each figure and their respective factions.</p>
<p><b>The third tab</b> (Chinese Civil War 1945-1949) roughly illustrates the progression of the civil war after the Japanese were defeated in the Second Sino-Japanese War. It does not contain any maps in its timeline prior to 1945. The timeline is meant to present how the Chinese Communist Party were able to defeat the Kuomintang forces, such as in their offensive in the Shandong Peninsula, and the speed at which the communist forces were able to become successful due to growing public support.</p></p>
