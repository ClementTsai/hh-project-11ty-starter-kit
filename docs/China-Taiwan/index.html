<p align="justify">At the turn of the twentieth century, numerous revolutions and calls for reformations broke out across the Qing Empire. Unable to suppress the people, China's dynastic government fell apart, leaving a massive power vacuum. The fall of the Qing dynasty not only marked the end of China's dynastic government, but also allowed for various ideologies to be nurtured and flourish. However, as a result, the rise of new ideologies also gave rise to new powerful factions which sought to wrangle control. These factions, though worked together to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and repel the Japanese invasion, fought against one another. However, with the withdrawal of the nationalists forces to the island of Taiwan, the conflict between the communists and the nationalists still persists, culminating in the current tensions in the Taiwan strait.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="fall-of-the-qing" tabindex="-1">Fall of the Qing<a class="tdbc-anchor" href="#fall-of-the-qing" aria-hidden="true">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
<p>After nearly three hundred years of imperial rule under the Qing dynasty, the 1911 revolution, or the Xinhai Revolution, brought an end to Chinaâ€™s two-thousand year long dynastic monarchy.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Following the collapse of Chinaâ€™s monarchial government, the revolutionists, under the leadership of Sun Yat-sen, formed the new Republic of China which then appointed Yuan Shikai as its first president. However, Yuan Shikai wanted to restore the hereditary monarchy in China by declaring himself the Hongxian Emperor.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> Ultimately, his death and abdication in 1916 led to a massive fragmentation of the Chinese political system and a power struggle against multiple factions.</p>
<h3 id="united-front" tabindex="-1">United Front<a class="tdbc-anchor" href="#united-front" aria-hidden="true">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
<p>To combat the threat of warlords controlling massive swathes of China, thus preventing a unification of Chinaâ€™s government, Sun Yat-sen would form a new government in Guangzhou with the Kuomintang. As Western powers refused to offer Sun Yat-sen military aid, he, and the Kuomintang, turned to the Soviet Union for assistance. As a result, the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang were jointly united to form the First United Front.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> However, shortly after the death of Sun Yat-sen in 1925, relations between the KMT and the CCP soured as a rumour began to manifest that the Soviet Union was seeking to destroy the KMT from within using the CCP.</p>
<h3 id="the-split" tabindex="-1">The Split<a class="tdbc-anchor" href="#the-split" aria-hidden="true">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
<p>No longer tolerant of the communist influence within the ranks of the Kuomintang, Chiang Kai-shek, the succeeding leader of the KMT after Sun Yat-senâ€™s passing, joined several other KMT leaders to propose a communist purge. On April 12th, 1927, a violent suppression of the Chinese Communist Party and leftist elements in Shanghai were enacted by Chiang Kai-shekâ€™s conservative forces and allies. The Shanghai Massacre effectively split the right and left wing factions within the KMT. Chiang Kai-shek would continue to lead the right-wing forces of the Kuomintang while the left-wing Kuomintang government was led by Wang Jingwei. Ultimately, the massacre also led to the collapse of the First United Front as communist forces began to launch uprisings to regain power - marking the start of the Chinese Civil War.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="second-united-front" tabindex="-1">Second United Front<a class="tdbc-anchor" href="#second-united-front" aria-hidden="true">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
<p>With Japanâ€™s sudden invasion and occupation of Manchuria, Chiang Kai-shek was forced to sign a truce with the Chinese Communist Party after being kidnapped by his own general in the Xiâ€™an Incident. Both the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party momentarily halted their fighting to form a second united front to fight against the Japanese. However, in 1937, Japanâ€™s full-scale invasion of China overran Kuomintang defenders in northern and coastal China, significantly weakening the nationalist forces. Despite their uneasy alliance, the cooperation between the two factions was unstable as they both vied for control and power. Furthermore, despite the military alliance against Japan, the two factions continued to engage in bloody clashes against one another. Eventually, the Second United Front collapsed after CCP forces were ambushed by the KMT during an evacuation of the Anhui and Jiangsu Provinces.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="communist-support" tabindex="-1">Communist Support<a class="tdbc-anchor" href="#communist-support" aria-hidden="true">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
<p>As the Kuomintang was the legal government of China at the time, they were forced to carry the burden of taking the full brunt force of the Japanese invasion. On the other hand, the Chinese Communst Party was able to commit themselves to guerilla war tactics that generally won them support in Japanese-occupied areas.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> By the end of the war, the Communist forces had grown to around 1.3 million members with a separate militia of over 2.6 million. The nationalists, on the other hand, suffered significant casualties to their forces during their clashes with the Japanese.</p>
<h3 id="communist-victory" tabindex="-1">Communist Victory<a class="tdbc-anchor" href="#communist-victory" aria-hidden="true">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
<p>After resisting the invasion of Japanese forces, the two factions eventually returned to a full-scale war, with the Communist offensive in the Shandong Peninsula being largely successful.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup> Ultimately, with the support of the people under communist-occupied lands and the CCPâ€™s experience in guerilla warfare, much of the Kuomintang, which had already sustained heavy casualties during the Second Sino-Japanese War, were unable to resist. As a result, Chiang Kai-shek, the nationalist party, and the Kuomintang were forced to withdraw to the island of Taiwan while Mao Zedong proclaimed the founding of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China in Beijing.</p>
<h3 id="aftermath" tabindex="-1">Aftermath<a class="tdbc-anchor" href="#aftermath" aria-hidden="true">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
<p>Over the following years, the Chinese Communist Party sought to crush the remnants of the Kuomintang on the island of Taiwan. However, their attempts were thwarted by the United States who offered their full support for Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang. After the Korean War, President Harry S. Truman issued for the United States Seventh Fleet to sail to the Taiwan Strait as part of his policy of containment against Communist influence. Thus, in the past few decades, both the CCP and KMT have declared themselves as the proper government of China. As such, tensions between Taiwan and China have become strained.</p>
<h3 id="why-the-conflict-remains-relevant" tabindex="-1">Why the Conflict Remains Relevant<a class="tdbc-anchor" href="#why-the-conflict-remains-relevant" aria-hidden="true">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
<p>As both the Taiwanese and Chinese government recognize themselves as the legitimate government of China's mainland, tensions have grown over the past few decades. While government of the People's Republic of China affirms that Taiwan is part of China, frequent disagreements have let to large amount of arms placed on either coasts. Moreover, with the United States defending Taiwan, tensions between the two nuclear powers have intensified.</p>
<p>On an economic scale, Taiwan is responsible for 92% of the world's most advanced semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. These semiconductor chips are used across multiple industries such as technology, appliances and medical equipment. A disruption in its process would damage the global supply chain and likely cause further production slowdowns and a subsequent economic slowdown.</p>
